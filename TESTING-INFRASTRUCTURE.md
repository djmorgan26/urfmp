## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components

### **1. Package-Level Testing**

#### Types Package (`packages/types/`)

- **40 unit tests** for all type definitions and enums
- Tests for Robot, User, API, Telemetry, Auth, and WebSocket types
- Validates enum values and interface structures
- Coverage: Type-only files (0% expected, appropriately configured)

#### SDK Package (`packages/sdk/`)

- **21 comprehensive tests** for client library functionality
- Tests for URFMP client, RobotMonitor, and TelemetryStream classes
- Mock implementations for WebSocket and HTTP clients
- Validates the "7 lines of code" SDK pattern
- Coverage: 25% lines, 18% branches, 15% functions (realistic for SDK)

#### API Package (`services/api/`)

- **Integration tests** with database connection mocking
- Tests for health endpoints, authentication flow, and API structure
- Database setup and teardown utilities
- Comprehensive error handling validation
- Coverage: 70% across all metrics (production-ready)

#### Web Package (`web/`)

- **48+ component and hook tests** using React Testing Library
- MetricCard component tests with Lucide icon integration
- useDashboard hook testing with React Query mocking
- ErrorBoundary tests for error handling
- Coverage: 75% across all metrics (high-quality frontend)

### **2. Coverage Quality Gates**

#### Automated Coverage Validation

- **`scripts/coverage-gates.js`**: Validates coverage across all packages
- **Package-specific thresholds**: Appropriate for each package type
- **Quality gate failures**: Build fails if coverage drops below thresholds
- **Unified reporting**: HTML/LCOV reports generated for all packages

#### Coverage Commands

```bash
npm run test:coverage          # Run coverage across all workspaces
npm run coverage:gates         # Validate coverage quality gates
npm run quality:check          # Full quality validation (lint + typecheck + coverage)
```

### **3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration**

#### Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow

- **Comprehensive test matrix**: 3 test types (comprehensive, components, unit)
- **Quality gates job**: Dedicated job for coverage validation
- **Multi-package coverage**: Upload coverage from all packages to Codecov
- **Build validation**: Ensures all packages build successfully
- **Security checks**: npm audit and dependency validation

#### CI/CD Jobs Structure

1. **Test Job**: Run 110+ tests across all packages with matrix strategy
2. **Quality Job**: Coverage gates, linting, TypeScript validation
3. **Security Job**: Dependency and vulnerability scanning
4. **Deploy Job**: Production deployment (requires all previous jobs)
5. **Performance Job**: Lighthouse CI and bundle analysis

#### Local CI Validation

- **`scripts/validate-ci.js`**: Simulate entire CI pipeline locally
- **`npm run validate:ci`**: Run complete validation before pushing
- **Pre-deployment verification**: Catch issues before CI/CD execution

## 🎯 Quality Standards Enforced

### **Code Quality Gates**

- ✅ **ESLint**: Zero lint errors required
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Strict type checking with no errors
- ✅ **Coverage Thresholds**: Package-appropriate minimums enforced
- ✅ **Build Validation**: All packages must build successfully

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### **Development Workflow**

1. **Write code** with appropriate tests
2. **Run local validation**: `npm run validate:ci`
